# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
-There were "x" votes cast in the election.
-The candidates were:
    -Charles Casper Stockham
    -Diana DeGette
    -Raymon Anthony Doane
-The candidate results were:
    -Charles Casper Stockham recieved 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
    -Diana DeGette recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    -Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
-The winner of the elecion was:
    -Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    
## Challenge Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections has requested additional data to complete the audit of the recent local congressional election.

1. Get a complete list of counties with election results.
2. Calculate the total numner of votes from each county.
3. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county.
4. Determine the county with the most votes cast.

## Challenge Summary
-There were 369,711 votes cast during this congressional election.

-Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes and 73.8% of the votes.

###Business Proposal:
The python code developed for the local congressional election can be utilized to audit other congressional elections. 1.)The "election results" csv file can be updated with new election results from other congressional elections. After updating the csv file, the python code can be run again with the new data. 2.)Another option would be to create new csv files with the name of the local election as "election results-congressional name".csv.  Then the python code would have to be updated to look at the new congressional election csv file.
